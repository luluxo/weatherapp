# weatherapp

Hello this simple weather app is part of my project to learn more javascript with project based learning ! 

With this project im going to get a deeper understanding for apis and javascript techniques.

So now that im finished let me describe it ! 

The background images used is source.unsplash.com even though they have a new website the old links still work

The API used for the weather was openweathermap.org by downloading .json chrome extension. and pulling the data through that.
